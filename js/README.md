# VTK Learning - VTK.js

## Getting VTK.js
For use in applications you can use `npm install @kitware/vtk.js`.

You'll probably also want a local copy of `vtk.js` in easily accessible source code form. You can get this by cloning the repository: git clone https://github.com/Kitware/vtk-js.git

Alternatively, you may want to fork the `vtk.js` repository and clone your fork. This is a good idea if you intend to make any contributions back to the main `vtk.js` project.

### Examples
VTK.js comes up with a number of examples which are found under `vtk-js/Examples`. 

### Hello VTK
Includes a number of very simple projects demonstrating the use of VTK.js.
