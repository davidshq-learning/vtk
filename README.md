# VTK Learning

This is a simple repository that contains some code that demonstrates various portions of VTK/VTK.js.

- The python sub-folder contains Python code that interacts with the traditional VTK.
    - In this case, the Python code wraps VTK (C/C++)
- The js sub-folder contains JS code that interacts with VTK.js.
    - In this case, VTK.js is a port of VTK with some changes and differences in functionality.
